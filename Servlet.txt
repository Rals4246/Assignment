Basic idea of what i know about servlets:


Servlet is used for web programming , it was the basic  programming used for datatransfer/communication between user and clients. 

there are two main classes in servlets. they are 1) generic servlet 2) http servlet.

 we use request and  response to communicate with server. 

servlet acts as a container where it takes the requests and sends the corresponding response. init, service and destroy are the three main methods of servlet. 

Httpservlet has two main methods doget() and dopost()methods. 

Normally when a servlet is initialized, using request and response methods we can communicate between users and server.  

Today we learnt about Servletcontext and servletconfig. But i did not work too much on those.
